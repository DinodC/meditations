    When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today
    will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They
    are like this because they can't tell good from evil.

    We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows
    of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel
    anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are obstructions.

    Whatever the nature of the whole does, and whatever serves to maintain it,
    is good for every part of nature. The world is maintained by change - in the
    elements and in the things they compose.

    At some point you have to recognize what world it is that you belong to;
    what power rules it and from what source you spring; that there is a limit
    to the time assigned you, and if you don't use it to free yourself it will
    be gone and will never return.

    """
    Concentrate every minute like a Roman - like a man - on doing what's in
    front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with
    justice. And on freeing yourself from all other distractions.

    """
    Yes, you can - if you do everything as if it were the last thing you were
    doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions
    override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centered,
    irritable.

    Do external things distract you? Then make time for yourself to learn
    something worthwhile; stop letting yourself be pulled in all directions.

    But make sure you guard against the other kind of confusion. People who
    labor all their lives but have no purpose to direct every thought and

    You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and

    But death and life, success and failure, pain and pleasure, wealth and
    poverty, all these happen to good and bad people alike, and they are neither

    Nothing is more pathetic than people who run around in circles, "delving
    into the things that lie beneath" and conducting investigations into the
    souls of the people around them, never realizing that all you have to do is
    to be attentive to the power inside you and worship it sincerely.

    What is divine deserves our respect because it is good; what is human
    deserves our affection because it is like us. And our pity too, sometimes,

    Even if you're going to live three thousand more years, or ten times that,

    The present is the same for everyone; its loss is the same for everyone; and

    The human soul degrades itself, above all, when it does its best to become
