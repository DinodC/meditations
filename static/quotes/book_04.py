    Our inward power, when it obeys nature, reacts to events by accommodating

    People try to get away from it all - to the country, to the beach, to the

    Nowhere you can go is more peaceful - more free of interruptions - than your
    own soul. Especially if you have other things to rely on. An instant's
    recollection and there it is: complete tranquility. And by tranquility I
    mean a kind of harmony.

    So keep getting away from it all - like that. Renew yourself. But keep it
    brief and basic. A quick visit should be enough to ward off all <...> and

    So keep this refuge in mind: the back roads of your self. Above all, no

    Two kinds of readiness are constantly needed: (i) to do only what the logos

    reconsider your position, when someone can set you straight or convert you
    to his.
