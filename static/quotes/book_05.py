    At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: "I have to
    go to work - as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I'm going
    to do what I was born for - the things I was brought into the world to do?
    Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay
    warm?"

    -But we have to sleep sometime.... Agreed. But nature set a limit on that -
    as it did on eating and drinking. And you're over the limit. You've had more
     than enough of that. But not of working. There you're still below your
     quota.

    People who love what they do wear themselves down doing it, they even forget
    to wash or eat. Do you have less respect for your own nature than the
    engraver does for engraving, the dancer for the dance, the miser for money
    or the social climber for status? When they're really possessed by what they
    do, they'd rather stop eating and sleeping than give up practicing their
    arts.

    Practice the virtues you can show: honesty, gravity, endurance, austerity,
    resignation, abstinence, patience, sincerity, moderation, seriousness, high-

    Some people, when they do someone a favor, are always looking for a chance
    to call it in. And some aren't, but they're still aware of it - still regard
    it as a debt. But others don't even do that. They're like a vine that
    produces grapes without looking for anything in return.

    Prayer of the Athenians: 'Zeus, rain down, rain down, on the land and fields

    Just as you overhear people saying that 'the doctor prescribed such-and-such
    for him' (like riding, or cold baths,or walking barefoot...), say this:
    'Nature prescribed illness for him.' Or blindness. Or the loss of a limb. Or
    whatever. There 'prescribed' means something like 'ordered, so as to further
    his recovery.' And so too here. What happens to each of us is ordered. It
    furthers our destiny.

    Accept it because of what it leads to: the good health of the world and the
    well-being and prosperity of Zeus himself, who would not have brought this

    do that - bring something about that wasn't beneficial to what it governed.

    So there are two reasons to embrace what happens. One is that it's happening
    to you. It was prescribed for you, and it pertains to you. The thread was
    spun long ago, by the oldest cause of all.
    The other reason is that what happens to an individual is a cause of well -
    being in what directs the world - of its well-being, its fulfillment, of its
    very existence, even.

    Not to feel exasperated, or defeated, or despondent because your days aren't

    We need to comfort ourselves and wait for dissolution. And not get impatient
    in the meantime, but take refuge in these two things: i. Nothing can happen

     own spirit don't approve. No one can force me to.

    What am I doing with my soul?
    Interrogate yourself, to find out what inhabits your so-called mind and what

    tyrant's soul? The soul of a predator - or it's prey?

    The things you think about determine the quality of your mind. Your soul

    ii. Things gravitate toward what they were intended for.

    Nothing happens to anyone that he can't endure. The same thing happens to

    The mind is the ruler of the soul. It should remain unstirred by agitations
    of the flesh - gentle and violent ones alike. Not mingling with them, but
    fencing itself off and keeping those feelings in their place. When they make
    their way into your thoughts, through the sympathetic link between mind and
    body, don't try to resist the sensation. The sensation is natural. But don't
    let the mind start in with judgments, calling it 'good' or 'bad'.
