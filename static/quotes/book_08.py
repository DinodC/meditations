    So you know how things stand. Now forget what they think of you. Be satisfied
    if you can live the rest of your life, however short, as your nature demands.
    Focus on that, and don't let anything distract you. You've wandered all over
    and finally realized that you never found what you were after: how to live.
    Not in syllogisms, not in money, or fame, or self-indulgence. Nowhere.

    -What principles?
    Those to do with good and evil. That nothing is good except what leads to
    fairness, and self-control, and courage, and free will. And nothing bad
    except what does the opposite.

    For every action, ask: How does it affect me? Could I change my mind about
    it?
    """,
    """
    The first step: Don't be anxious. Nature controls it all. And before long
    you'll be no one, nowhere - like Hadrian, like Augustus.
    The second step: Concentrate on what you have to do. Fix your eyes on it.
    Remind yourself that your task is to be a good human being; remind yourself
    what nature demands of people. Then do it, without hesitation, and speak the
    truth as you see it. But with kindness. With humility. Without hypocrisy.
    """,
    """
    No time for reading. For controlling your arrogance, yes. For overcoming
    pain and pleasure, yes. For outgrowing ambition, yes. For not feeling anger
    at stupid and unpleasant people - even for caring about them - for that, yes.
    """,
    """
    Remorse is annoyance at yourself for having passed up something that's to
    your benefit. But if it's to your benefit it must be good - something a
    truly good person would be concerned about.
    But no truly good person would feel remorse at passing up pleasure.
    So it cannot be to your benefit, or good.

    """
    When you have trouble getting out of bed in the morning, remember that your
    defining characteristic - what defines a human being - is to work with
    others. Even animals know how to sleep. And it's the characteristic activity
    that's the more natural one - more innate and more satisfying.

    Apply them constantly, to everything that happens: Physics. Ethics. Logic.

    Remember: you shouldn't be surprised that fig tree produces figs, nor the
    world what it produces. A good doctor isn't surprised when his patients have
    fevers, or a helmsman when the wind blows against him.

    Remember that to change your mind and to accept correction are free acts too.
    The action is yours, based on your own will, your own decision - and your

    If it's in your control, why do you do it? If it's in someone else's then
    who are you blaming? Atoms? The gods? Stupid either way.
    """,

    Blame no one. Set people straight, if you can. If not, just repair the
    damage. And suppose you can't do that either. Then where does blaming people

    Either pain affects the body (which is the body's problem) or it affects the

    To erase false perceptions, tell yourself: I have it in me to keep my soul

    You have to assemble your life yourself - action by action. And be satisfied

    Don't let your imagination be crushed by life as a whole. Don't try to
