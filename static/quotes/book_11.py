    To acquire indifference to pretty singing, to dancing, to the martial arts.
    Analyze the melody into the notes that form it, and as you hear each one,

    Look at the individual parts and move from analysis to indifference. Apply

    The resolute soul: resolute in separation from the body. And then in the
    dissolution or fragmentation - or continuity. But the resolution has to be
    the result of its own decision, not just in response to outside forces.

    The branch is cut off by someone else. But people cut themselves off -
    through rejection - and don't realize that they're cutting themselves off

    Because anger, too, is weakness, as much as breaking down and giving up the

    The natural can never be inferior to the artificial; art imitates nature,
    not the reverse. In which case, that most highly developed and comprehensive
    nature - Nature itself - cannot fall short of artifice in craftsmanship.

    It's the pursuit of these things, and your attempts to avoid them, that

    Someone hates me. Their problem. Mine: to be patient and cheerful with

    A straightforward, honest person should be like someone who stinks: when

    And why is it so hard when things go against you? If it's imposed by nature,
