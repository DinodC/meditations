    Everything you're trying to reach you could have right now, this moment. If
    you'd only stop thwarting your own attempts. If you'd only let go of the
    past, entrust the future to Providence, and guide the present toward
    reverence and justice.

    """
    Reverence: so you'll accept what you're allotted. Nature intended it for you,
    and you for it.

    """
    Justice: so that you'll speak the truth, frankly and without evasions, and
    act as you should - and as other people deserve.
    """,
    """
    Don't let anything deter you: other people's misbehavior, your own
    misperceptions, What People Will Say, or the feelings of the body that
    covers you. And if, when it's time to depart, you shunt everything aside
    except your mind and the divinity within...

    No longer an alien in your own land.
    No longer shocked by everyday events - as if they were unheard-of
    aberrations.
    No longer at the mercy of this or that.

    Your three components: body, breath, mind. Two are yours in trust; to the
    third alone you have clear title.

    If you can cut yourself free of what other people do and say, of what you've
    said or done, of the things that you're afraid will happen, the impositions
    of the body that contains you and the breath within, and what the whirling
    chaos sweeps in from outside.
    """,
    """
    If you can cut free of impressions that cling to the mind, free of the
    future and the past - can make yourself, as Empedocles says, 'a sphere
    rejoicing in its perfect stillness,'' and concentrate on living what can be
    lived (which means the present)...

    """
    It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people,
    but care more about their opinion than our own.
    """,
    """
    If a god appeared to us or a wise human being and prohibited us from
    concealing our thoughts or imagining anything without immediately shouting
    it out, we wouldn't make it through a single day. That's how much we value
    other people's opinions - instead of our own.

    Practice even what seems impossible.
    The left hand is useless at almost everything, for lack of practice. But it
    guides the reins better than the right. From practice.

    The student as boxer, not fencer.
    The fencer's weapon is picked up and put down again.
    The boxer's part of him. All he has to do is clench his fist.

    """
    To see things as they are. Substance, cause and purpose.

    """
    The foolishness of people who are surprised by anything that happens. Like
    travelers amazed at foreign customs.

    The lamp shines until it is put out, without losing its gleam, and yet in

    When someone seems to have injured you, keep in mind:
    * that he's already been tried and convicted - by himself
    * that to expect a bad person not to harm others is like expecting fig trees
    not to secrete juice, babies not to cry, horses not to neigh.

    What else could they do - with that sort of character?
    If you're still angry, then get to work on that.

    At all times, look at the thing itself - the thing behind the appearance - and

    Essential at all times:
    i. your own actions: that they're not arbitrary or different from what
    abstract justice would do.

    What all things are like, from the planting of the seed to the quickening of
    life, and from its quickening to its relinquishment. Where the parts came

    That if you were suddenly lifted up and could see life and its variety from
    a vast height, and at the same time all the things around you, in the sky

    Salvation: to see each thing for what it is - its nature and its purpose.

    rings of a chain, without the slightest gap.

    How the mind conducts itself. It all depends on that. All the rest is within

    You've lived as a citizen in a great city. Five years or a hundred - what's
    the difference? The laws make no distinction. And to be sent away from it,
