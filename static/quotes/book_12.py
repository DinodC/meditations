    Everything you're trying to reach - by taking the long way round - you could
    have right now, this moment. If you'd only stop thwarting your own attempts.
    If you'd only let go of the past, entrust the future to Providence, and
    guide the present toward reverence and justice.
    Reverence: so you'll accept what you're allotted. Nature intended it for you,
    and you for it.
    Justice: so that you'll speak the truth, frankly and without evasions, and
    act as you should - and as other people deserve.

    Don't let anything deter you: other people's misbehavior, your own
    misperceptions, What People Will Say, or the feelings of the body that
    covers you (let the affected part take care of those). And if, when it's
    time to depart, you shunt everything aside except your mind and the divinity
    within... if it isn't ceasing to live that you're afraid of but never
    beginning to live properly... then you'll be worthy of the world that made
    you.

    No longer an alien in your own land.

    aberrations.
    No longer at the mercy of this or that.

    Your three components: body, breath, mind. Two are yours in trust; to the

    If you can cut yourself - your mind - free of what other people do and say,
    of what you've said or done, of the things that you're afraid will happen,
    the impositions of the body that contains you and the breath within, and
    what the whirling chaos sweeps in from outside, so that the mind is freed
    from fate, brought to clarity, and lives life on its own recognizance -
    doing what's right, accepting what happens, and speaking the truth.

    If you can cut free of impressions that cling to the mind, free of the
    future and the past - can make yourself, as Empedocles says, "a sphere
    rejoicing in its perfect stillness," and concentrate on living what can be
    lived (which means the present)... then you can spend the time you have left
    in tranquility. And in kindness. And at peace within the spirit within you.

    It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people,
    but care more about their opinion than our own. If a god appeared to us - or
    a wise human being, even - and prohibited us from concealing our thoughts or
    imagining anything without immediately shouting it out, we wouldn't make it
    through a single day. That's how much we value other people's opinions -
    instead of our own.

    Practice even what seems impossible.

    When someone seems to have injured you:
    But how can I be sure?
    And in any case, keep in mind:
    * that he's already been tried and convicted - by himself. (Like scratching
    your own eyes out.)
    * that to expect a bad person not to harm others is like expecting fig trees
    not to secrete juice, babies not to cry, horses not to neigh - the
    inevitable not to happen.

    Three things, essential at all times:
    i(a). your own actions: that they're not arbitrary or different from what
    abstract justice would do.
    i(b). external events: that they happen randomly or by design. You can't
    complain about chance. You can't argue with Providence.
    ii. what all things are like, from the planting of the seed to the
    quickening of life, and from its quickening to its relinquishment. Where the
    parts came from and where they return to.
    iii. that if you were suddenly lifted up and could see life and its variety
    from a vast height, and at the same time all the things around you, in the
    sky and beyond it, you'd see how pointless it is. And no matter how often
    you saw it, it would be the same: the same life forms, the same life span.

    To be angry at something means you've forgotten:
    That everything that happens is natural.
    That the responsibility is theirs, not yours.

    That whatever happens has always happened, and always will, and is happening
    at this very moment, everywhere. Just like this.

    rings of a chain, without the slightest gap.

    You've lived as a citizen in a great city. Five years or a hundred - what's
    the difference? The laws make no distinction.

    Nature, who first invited you in - why is that so terrible?

    "But I've only gotten through three acts...!"
    Yes. This will be a drama in three acts, the length fixed by the power that
    directed your creation, and now directs your dissolution. Neither was yours
    to determine.
